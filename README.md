# ITCS473 Course Project
Internet Software Development:

The aim of this project is to use most webpage elements learned throughout the course
and create a website with some degree of functionality. This is a course project and NOT a commercial website for professional use
as you might notice. This is to test the students knowledge ONLY. This may be updated as needed and probably be dropped at the end of 
the course, as it is not really that tempting to work on.
